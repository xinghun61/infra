# This file implements the discovery service, originally described here:
# https://godoc.org/github.com/luci/luci-go/grpc/discovery
# This service keeps track of all services which have been registered via
# add_service, and the autogenerated FileDescriptors which are in the files
# defining those services' inputs and outputs.
#
# This service is used automatically from prpc/grpc/__init__:Server.
