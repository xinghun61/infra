    <h2>Sheriff-o-Matic Help</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Sheriff-o-Matic (SoM) is a tool designed to help make sheriffing easier. SoM shows alerts for failures and allows you to
        place some basic annotations on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>To start looking at alerts, click on any of the trees to the left.  </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you encounter any issues with Sheriff-o-Matic, you can file a bug by clicking on the feedback button
        in the bottom right corner of the screen.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Sheriff</h3>
      <p>
        Your main goal as a sheriff is to keep the tree you are sheriffing open
        and green, so that people can submit changes. The alerts on Sheriff-o-Matic
        represent test failures, which can cause problems for the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sheriff-o-Matic provides context surrounding build or test failures, such as ranges
        of relevant commits, to help you determine the cause of a failure.
        As a sheriff, you will often handle failures by reverting culprit patches,
        filing bugs to address root causes, or potentially disabling tests.
      </p>

      <h3>Alert Actions on Sheriff-o-Matic</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Examine</strong> failures to see detailed information on related revisions. </li>
        <li><strong>Comment</strong> on alerts to leave notes for other sheriffs to see. </li>
        <li><strong>Snooze</strong> an alert to temporarily move a failure outside of your view. </li>
        <li><strong>Link a Bug</strong> to an alert to keep track of which bug caused the failure.
          <ul>
            <li>Find bugs to link from the <a href="http://crbug.com" target="_blank">Chromium Issue Tracker</a>.</li>
            <li>To link a bug, you can enter the URL or number for the bug. </li>
            <li>If a bug does not yet exist for the failure, you can file a new bug.
              If you do so, remember to go back to Sheriff-o-Matic to link the bug! </li>
          </ul>
